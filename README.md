- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @jayCleverly
- I'm interested in becoming a full stack engineer after I finish a software engineering degree.
- I currently run a small web development buisness for small companies wanting to have an online presence.
- I like to create projects for all areas in computing, with front end design being a key favourite. 
- I hope you find my projects interesting!
